# Python Basics Practice

This repository contains beginner-level Python programs covering topics such as:

- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- Bitwise operations

# Python Practice Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate level Python programs. These scripts are designed to help you practice and understand fundamental concepts in Python programming, including:

- Arithmetic operations
- Bitwise operations
- Graph plotting with `matplotlib`
- Basic GUI applications using `tkinter`
- Numpy and Pandas usage
- Conditional checks (e.g., eligibility systems)
- Simple mathematical utilities

## üìÅ Folder Structure

Each `.py` file is a standalone program. Some examples include:

- `arithmetic-example1.py` ‚Äì Basic arithmetic calculations
- `bitwise-complement-example.py` ‚Äì Demonstrates bitwise NOT
- `linear-equation-plotter.py` ‚Äì Visualizes linear equations
- `marriage-eligibility-checker.py` ‚Äì Conditional logic in practice
- `simple-tkinter-window.py` ‚Äì A basic tkinter GUI
